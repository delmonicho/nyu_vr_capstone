VR Showroom
Test your skills and practice interior design in VR to get a immersive sense of space with different furniture and decor.

###Audience
This VR Showroom would be great for interior designers but also anyone that wants to get an immersive sense of furniture items uploaded by vendors.


A list of at least three professional goals that align with your capstone project
###3 Professional Goals
1) This project aligns with my ambitions as a 3D and VR developer by constructing an immersive app with VR controls and hardware.
2) This kind of VR app is personally useful to me as I'm looking to redesign my own space and would like to know how furniture would fit in my living space before buying.
3) In addition to working with Unity in VR, working with a Quest 2 headset aligns with my career goals to be familiar and develop with VR headsets and especially Meta tools.

Working prototype as a stand-alone executable (and any associated files necessary to run the executable without Unity)
###Onboarding instructions
To get started, simply download the unity executable provided, then play the VR app on a Quest 2 headset.  Other hardware has not been tested.

There are controller tutorials and guides in game.  Use controllers to grab, move and redesign the furniture in the room as shown in the video demo.
